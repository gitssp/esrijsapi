This project explores various aspects of the Esri 4.0 JavaScript API.  It combines many of the samples on the Esri site into one application.  It also adds some additional Lat/Long functionality.  

### How do I get set up? ###

Install node.js and npm

Run these 2 npm commands:

**npm install**

**npm start**

start will start the lite server to run the application.  

### Supported Browsers ###

The site performs well in Chrome, and also has some ES6 (ES2015) syntax that isn't supported in older browsers.  
The 3D maps do not perform well in the Edge browser.  

### Who do I talk to? ###
